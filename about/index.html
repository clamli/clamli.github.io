        <p style="text-align:justify">Hi, my name is Boyi Li. I am currently a graduate student in the Computer Science department at the University of Texas at Austin.<br><br>I received my Bachelor’s degree in <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zhejiang University</a>, working with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MY23M60AAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiaolin Zheng</a>. My main research interests in my undergraduate stage lay within Recommender System. In my last semester, I did research in the Databases and Data Mining Laboratory at the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Simon Fraser</a> as a visiting student, under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Ester</a> and <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cskchung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chung, Fu-lai Korris</a>. During that time, I learned a lot about techniques of machine learning and knowledge of  recommender system, as well as how to define a problem, analyze it, and write a thesis to clarify the idea.<br><br>During my summer internship in <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National University of Singapore</a>, I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.brianlim.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Y. Lim</a>. I joined the lab <a href="http://bigheart.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIGHEART</a> and worked on a APP called <a href="http://www.brianlim.net/tastehealthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TastyHealthy</a>, which was developed to help log and recommend tasty and healthy food. I implemented an API interface by Flask for this APP. Whenever people upload a picture of food, the picture information will be forwarded to the API and the API will connect to another server to fetch the name, category and nutrition value of the food and sent them back to the APP. I also achieved an algorithm by generic algorithm to sort food according to their taste and health values. The food that is the tastiest should be on the far left while the food that is the healthiest should be on the far right.<br><br>I have a lot of interests, including badminton, cycling, cooking, reading, movie, music, and of course coding. I am eager to learn and hope to be a lifelong learner. I enjoy the peace from learning.</p>
